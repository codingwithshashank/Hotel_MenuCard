Digital Menu Card for Restaurant
Humming Byte Technologies pvt ltd • August 2024 - October 2024
•	Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express JS, React JS and PostgreSQL.
•	I created a scalable PostgreSQL database and developed a dynamic digital menu card with a user-friendly interface and responsive design for compatibility across devices. I built RESTful APIs to manage menu items and enhance user interaction, while also engineering a robust Express JS back-end that improved data processing speed by 40% and seamlessly integrated with the database.
